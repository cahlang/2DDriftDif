# 2DDriftDif
2-dimensional drift-diffusion simulation for thin-film solar cells. 

User Manual version 0.1 is now available! This might be enough to run your own simulations but is still lacking a lot of inromation. Feel free to contact me if you would like to use the simulation and need help getting started.

This program har been compiled successfully in Visual Studio on Windows 10.
