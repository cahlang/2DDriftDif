# 2DDriftDif
2-dimensional drift-diffusion simulation for thin-film solar cells. 

Unfortunately, the documentation for this program is essentially non-existent but will be updated (slowly) as I have time. Feel free to contact me if you would like to use the simulation and need help getting started.

This program har been compiled successfully in Visual Studio on Windows 10.
